            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p class="description">Hiding their identities behind masks and black body paint whilst baring their pain for the world with their music, Sleep Token are among the most enigmatic outfits in metal. It should be no surprise, then, that the stories told within their songs are equally as mystical and open to interpretation. Only one thing is definitive: the UK band is fronted by Vessel, and they are "committed" to worshipping the ancient deity known as Sleep. Each song is a Token (or an offering) in the name of Sleep.</p>

            <h3>Music style:</h3>
            <p class="description">Sleep Token's genre is a mix of progressive and alternative metal with elements of pop, R&B, and even old gospel music. Their songs are typically longer and feature drastic changes in sound between multiple genres in a way that really makes them stand out.</p>
            <p class="description">Here's what they said about themselves in their only interview of 2017:<br><span>"Life is dark. Life is bright. Life is ugly. Life is beautiful. Don't get lost in genres, they'll only disorientate you. Music is for everyone."</span></p>
